# Extracting-interview-experiences-from-IndiaBix

In this project I have used python to scrap website. I have taken IndiaBix website and scraped it extracting all the Interview experience offered by the Website. I have stored the data under the headings - Company_Name,  Experience of, Keywords, Title_of_Experience, URL, Interview_Experience.

I have used Urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries to open and parse the website respectively. I have saved the extracted data in a .csv file.
